Shoot for the Stars - A goal-based self motivation website


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

### Elevator pitch

Many of us have a lot of different things that we want to get done, but lack the self-motivation to complete it. Shoot for the Stars is a solution to that! Just pick a thing you want, and Shoot for the Stars will help you use it as a motivator to achieve your goals and start good habits. With a simple and intuitve design, it'll keep you coming back until you achieve everything you'd hoped, if not more!
